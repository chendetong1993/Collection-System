## Project description ##

This project is a collection system. Here, I only upload part of it.

1. One part is a module for collecting data from a collection system, it can automatically download files from a remote linux system and then delete downloaded files on that remote linux system.

2. One part is a module for labeling and storing data, it can label the data with a specific name and store it in a specific location.
